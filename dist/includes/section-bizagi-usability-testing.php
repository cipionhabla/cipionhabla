<h3>Usability Testing at Bizagi</h3>
<p class="badge-title"><em>Elements:</em> <span class="badge badge--primary">User Research</span> <span class="badge badge--primary">Scientific Method</span></p>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p class="space-stack--m">Sadly, at Bizagi there are assumptions and requirements aren't ever questioned or tested. Validation is considered harmful to projects.</p>
<h4>Challenge</h4>
<p class="space-stack--m">The challenge is to use experimentation, test the assumptions and requirements to discover their validity when it's cheapest to do so.</p>
<h4>Process</h4>
<p class="space-stack--m">Inspired by the scientific method I set a systematic way of finding out reliable information about the world of customer behavior to test the assumptions and requirements.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p class="space-stack--m">The cost of supporting users of a poorly-designed product is much greater than the cost of fixing the product while it is still being developed.</p>
