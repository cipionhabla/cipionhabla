<h4>Individual Interviews</h4>
<p class="space-stack--m">I made 5 interviews to get a deeper understanding of the users who use the app and found: People are struggling with login, navigation, forms, and projects. Also, there are 2 groups of people: Managers and clerks. With those insights, I selected the users and defined the scenarios for the usability tests.</p>
<h4>Usability Testing</h4>

<p class="space-stack--s">To uncover pain points while using the ios app, I conducted 5 usability test. I gave each user scenario based tasks to complete within the app:</p>
<ol class="list space-stack--m">
  <li class="list__item">Imagine you are a manager and go on a business travel, but you have to report your expenses so the company gets your money back. A coworker told you about the mobile app Bizagi. Could you show me what you would do?</li>
  <li>Now that you have reported some expenses, as a manager, you need to approve expenses for your employees. You heard from a friend that you can do that too on Bizagi. What would you do?</li>
</ol>
<h4>Insights: Affinity Map</h4>
<p class="space-stack--m">I synthesized my findings under 5 categories, the same I found in individual interviews. The findings from my research were then organized on an affinity map to better understand their relationship to each other and to determine priorities moving forward.</p>

<p class="space-stack--s">Base on the study, here are the 5 problems I decided to focus on:</p>
<ul class="list">
  <li class="list__item">Difficult to log in, too technical.</li>
  <li class="list__item">Difficult to send the activity of a case.</li>
  <li class="list__item">Challenge to navigate through the main features.</li>
  <li class="list__item">Difficult to switch between projects.</li>
  <li class="list__item">Difficult to know what is going on.</li>
</ul>
