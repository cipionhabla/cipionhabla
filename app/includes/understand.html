<h4>Individual Interviews</h4>
<p class="space-stack-m">I made 3 interviews to get a deeper understanding of the users who use the app and found 2 groups of people: Managers and clerks. With those groups, I selected the users and defined the scenarios for the usability tests.</p>

<p>To uncover pain points while using the ios app, I conducted 3 usability test. I gave each user three scenario based tasks to complete within the app:</p>
<ol class="list">
  <li class="list__item">Imagine you can take vacations in your company and you want to request them quickly and from anywhere. A coworker told you about the mobile app Bizagi. Could you show me what you would do?</li>
</ol>
